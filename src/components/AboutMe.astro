      Hi! My name is Bautista Tobal, but everyone calls me Bauti. My journey
      into the tech world began when I decided to pursue a degree in Computer
      Engineering. Since then,<strong>
        I&apos;ve been honing my skills in web development and working on
        projects that I&apos;m passionate about</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my career, <strong
        >I worked as a Sales Manager at Dentalis, where I managed and optimized
        sales for innovative dental care products</strong
      >. Currently, I&apos;m freelancing as a developer, creating custom digital
      solutions for clients across various industries, while continuing to
      expand my knowledge in programming and cybersecurity.
